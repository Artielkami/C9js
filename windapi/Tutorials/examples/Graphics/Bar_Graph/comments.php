Within this example, we display how to draw a bar graph .<br><br>
var g = new <a>WIND</a>.<a>Graphics</a>('myGraph',{'resizable':true,'draggable':true,'top':50});<br><br>
'<span id="param">myGraph</span>' is the identifier of the Graph.<br>


<br> var BarChartData is the variable within we put our data and labels in it.
<br> labels are the values for the X-Axis.
<br> our values are stored in datasets.
<br> More specifications are added like the colour of the graph.
