In this example, we have a map,a text and a timeline components.<br>
We add two annotations to the map, one annotation to the timeline and three annotations to the text ("Bayonne", "Pau", "2014-07-16 at 17:00").<br>
We create a "click" event for each annotation.<br>
<ul>
<li>If we "click" on "<span style="color:red">Bayonne</span>" either on the map or on the text annotation, the reaction "highlight" will be activated on the annotation of the map and the text.</li>
<li>If we "click" on "<span style="color:green">Pau</span>" either on the map or on the text annotation, the reaction "highlight" will be activated on the annotation of the map and the text.</li>
<li>If we "click" on "<span style="color:purple">2014-07-16 at 17:00</span>" either on the timeline or on the text annotation, the reaction "highlight" will be activated on the annotation of the timeline and the text.</li>
</ul>
