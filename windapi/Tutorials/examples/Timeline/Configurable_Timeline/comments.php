Within this example, we display a Timeline composed by two bands. The years band and the months band.<br><br>
var t = new <a href="<?php echo $documentation_path;?>/WIND.html" target="_blank">WIND</a>.<a href="<?php echo $documentation_path;?>/WIND.Timeline.html" target="_blank">Timeline</a>('<span id="param">timeline</span>', <span id="param">{'<span id="options">configurable</span>':true}</span>)<br><br>
'<span id="param">timeline</span>' is the identifier of the timeline.<br>
The <span id="options">configurable</span> option means that we can change the configuration of the timeline after it is displayed. If it is set to true, a button will be added on the righ of the header.<br>
If we click on it a menu will appear and then we can change:<br>
- The timeline's name<br>
- The color of the header and th border<br>
- The current zoom level of the timeline<br>
