Within this example, we display a Timeline composed by two bands. The years band and the months band.<br><br>
var t = new <a href="<?php echo $documentation_path;?>/WIND.html" target="_blank">WIND</a>.<a href="<?php echo $documentation_path;?>/WIND.Timeline.html" target="_blank">Timeline</a>('<span id="param">timeline</span>', <span id="param">{}</span>)<br><br>
WIND.Timeline is the class representing a Timeline component. <br>
'<span id="param">timeline</span>' is the identifier of the timeline.<br>
Here we didn't give any options so they all have a default value<br>
